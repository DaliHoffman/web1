This is a web project with the goal of replicating the website www.swallowtailtea.com

Two pages have been replicated. The HomePage and the Brew Wares page. To access the homepage use
npm install in the terminal to install all of the neccessary packages. Then use node app.js to view locally
or visit the link https://guarded-inlet-09807.herokuapp.com/ to visit the homepage. To visit the Brew Wares page
click the brew wares link in the NavBar. The website has the objective of developing all of my browser based
programming skills. 

CSS, JavaScript and HTML were all used to create a great user experience for any user visiting the web page.
On the home Page Responsivness has been added for 1000 pixel width.
The pages were formatted using a range of different displays. 
The images on the Brew Wares Page are dynamically fetched using JavaScript to the page
CSS was also used to show that the same result can be hardcoded using another strategy

JavaScript was used on the main page to transition through each background image dynamically to provide a great user experience for the user
